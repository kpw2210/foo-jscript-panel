# foo_jscript_panel

This is a fork of [marc2003](https://github.com/19379)'s [foo_jscript_panel](https://github.com/19379/foo-jscript-panel) with a few extensions of my own (mainly for personal usage).

Differences from vanilla foo_jscript_panel:
* Added IsMainMenuCommandChecked method.
* Added methods for window management from [foo_uie_wsh_panel_mod_plus](https://github.com/ttsping/foo_uie_wsh_panel_mod_plus).

For more info see [foo_jscript_panel](https://github.com/19379/foo-jscript-panel).
